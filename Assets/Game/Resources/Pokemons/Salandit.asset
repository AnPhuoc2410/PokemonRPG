  description: "Salandit emits toxic gas, together with flames, from the base of
    its tail. This poisonous gas has a sweet smell, and anyone who unknowingly breathes
    it in will become dizzy. Salandit is not a very powerful Pok\xE9mon, but its
    cunning nature allows it to battle fiercely by throwing its opponents off balance."
